I have included #deeplearning below mentioned interesting steps for this predictive model: 1. Traditional and Auto EDA (pandas_profilling) including visualization 2. Feature Extraction/Importance by Extra tree regressor. 3. Multicollinearity check by OLS model 4. Multicollinearity check by VIF calculation 5. Scaling of dataset 6. Sampling by train &amp; test split, keeping data leakage in consideration 7. Logistic regression model, observed 81.9% accuracy. 8. Pipeline building using sklearn - logistic regression 9. Model building by using k-Fold cross validation 10. Model evaluation- observed accuracy - 81.8%.
